# git-todo-tracker-web-client

This is .NET Razor project I developed for a web applications class.
As the course was project based this is my submission for the final evaluation.

This project is the frontend client that consumes the REST api from the server. See the backend project linked [here](https://github.com/emirhalici/git-todo-tracker).

# Get Started

To get started first setup the backend server and database image correctly. Instructions are listed on the project github link.

Then start this project by running

```
dotnet watch run
```
